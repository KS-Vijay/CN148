Problem Statement:

Organizing events, whether they're conferences, weddings, or corporate gatherings, involves numerous tasks such as venue selection, attendee registration, agenda planning, and logistics coordination. Traditional methods of managing events through spreadsheets or manual processes can be inefficient and error-prone. Your task is to develop an event management website that streamlines the entire event planning process, from initial setup to post-event evaluation, providing organizers with the tools they need to plan, promote, and execute successful events seamlessly.
